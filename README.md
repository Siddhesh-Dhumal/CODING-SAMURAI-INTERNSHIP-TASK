Python Internship Projects (Batch A53)

This repository contains the projects I completed during my Python Internship (Batch A53).
The internship focused on practical learning of Python programming, APIs, and application development.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECTS COMPLETED

1. Weather App (Using OpenWeatherMap API)
Description:
A Python-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly format.

Features:
- Fetches current weather for any city.
- Displays temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and description.
- Provides clean and readable console output.
- Built using requests and datetime modules.

Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Requests Library

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the WeatherApp.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Replace API_KEY in the script with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
4. Run the notebook and enter a city name when prompted.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. To-Do List App
Description:
A simple Python To-Do List application where users can add, view, update, and delete tasks.
This project helped practice file handling, lists, and basic CRUD operations in Python.

Features:
- Add new tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- View pending/completed tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Data persistence using a simple text file.

Tech Stack:
- Python

How to Run:
1. Open ToDoListApp.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook to interact with the menu-driven To-Do List application.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
Description:
A Python project that scrapes publicly available data (e.g., news headlines) from websites using the BeautifulSoup library and saves it into a CSV file.
This project demonstrates how to parse HTML content, extract useful information, and store it for later analysis.

Features:
- Fetches webpage content using requests.
- Parses and extracts relevant information (like headlines and links).
- Stores data in a structured format (CSV file).
- Easily adaptable for different websites (news, weather, quotes, etc.).

Tech Stack:
- Python
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- Requests
- CSV module

How to Run:
1. Open WebScrapingApp.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells in order.
3. The scraped data will be saved into news_headlines.csv (or similar file) in your working directory.

------------------------------------------------------------
LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Gained hands-on experience in Python programming.
- Learned how to integrate and use REST APIs.
- Practiced web scraping and HTML parsing.
- Improved problem-solving and logical thinking through real projects.
- Practiced using Jupyter Notebook for development.
- Understood the importance of writing clean, modular, and reusable code.
