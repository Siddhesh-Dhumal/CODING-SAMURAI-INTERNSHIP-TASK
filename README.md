Python Internship Projects (Batch A53)

This repository contains the projects I completed during my Python Internship (Batch A53).
The internship focused on practical learning of Python programming, APIs, and application development.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECTS COMPLETED

1. Weather App (Using OpenWeatherMap API)
Description:
A Python-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly format.

Features:
- Fetches current weather for any city.
- Displays temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and description.
- Provides clean and readable console output.
- Built using requests and datetime modules.

Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Requests Library

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the WeatherApp.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Replace API_KEY in the script with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
4. Run the notebook and enter a city name when prompted.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. To-Do List App
Description:
A simple Python To-Do List application where users can add, view, update, and delete tasks.
This project helped practice file handling, lists, and basic CRUD operations in Python.

Features:
- Add new tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- View pending/completed tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Data persistence using a simple text file.

Tech Stack:
- Python

How to Run:
1. Open ToDoListApp.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook to interact with the menu-driven To-Do List application.

------------------------------------------------------------
